# Image for the hosted connector on Fly.io (`fly deploy` from the repo root).
#
# Two stages: the first runs `skybridge build` (vite for the widgets, tsc for
# the server), which needs the devDependencies; the second carries only the
# production dependencies and dist/. `skybridge start` must run from /app,
# because it serves the widget assets from `process.cwd()/dist/assets`.
# Pinned to an exact tag (engines says >= 24.14.0) so a deploy today and a
# deploy next month build the same image; bump it deliberately.
