/**
 * The one public URL of this server, and the widget sandbox domain derived
 * from it.
 *
 * claude.ai renders a widget only when the resource's `_meta.ui.domain` equals
 * sha256(<connector URL exactly as the user pasted it>)[:32] +
 * ".claudemcpcontent.com". Skybridge 0.35.21 computes that hash per request
 * (node_modules/skybridge/dist/server/server.js, registerWidgetResource): from
 * the `x-alpic-forwarded-url` header when present, else from the forwarded or
 * Host header plus the request path. Alpic's ingress injected that header.
 * Fly's proxy does not, so without help the hash would follow whichever
 * hostname the request came in on: right on the custom domain, wrong on the
 * deprecated *.fly.dev host, and anchored to no constant anywhere.
 *
 * `pinPublicUrl` sets the header itself, from this constant, before Skybridge
 * sees the request. The hash is then a function of one string, and the test
 * beside this file pins both the string and the hash to their literal values.
 *
 * Change this and move every copy together: README.md ("Connect in 30
 * seconds"), CLAUDE.md ("Deployed:"), the fly.toml comment and its
 * PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN, .env.example, and the literals in public-url.test.ts
 * (which fails until they all agree). Outside the repo: the DNS CNAME, the Fly
 * certificate, cloud-finops-skills/INSTALLATION.md (which copies this URL) and
 * the Claude directory listing follow it. This file lives beside index.ts on
 * purpose: server/src/lib/ is generated from the calculator and must not gain
 * files.

 * that was observed on the first container run, where the hash still followed
 * the Host header. Existing copies of the header are removed from the raw list
